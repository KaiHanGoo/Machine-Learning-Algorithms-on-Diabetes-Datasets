There is an increasing prevalence of diabetes worldwide, which poses a serious public health concern. Early detection and effective treatment are necessary. In this work, machine learning algorithms are applied to diabetes risk prediction using 2 datasets namely PIMA Dataset and testing dataset (both collected from Kaggle). The paper highlights the evaluation of the performance of Logistic Regression (LOR), Decision Trees (DT), Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and AdaBoost. Prior to and following hyperparameter optimisation, the train and test accuracies, AUC values, and other assessment metrics of each model are examined. As a result of the analysis, we have found that machine learning can enhance diabetes prediction, facilitate early intervention, and improve patient outcomes.
